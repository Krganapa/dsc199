# Tackling and Analyzing COVID-19 with Data Science

<h2> <u> About </u> </h2>
This repo consists of all the  codebase, work, and references, for the Independent Study and Research for Data Science (DSC-199) course from UCSD during Summer 2020 under Ilya Zaslavsky, Director of Spatial Information Systems Laboratory and Peter Rose, Director of Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. 

The project involves quering Viral proteins in a large community Knowledge Graph, and using this inforomation for COVID modeling by analyzing the same from Bioinfromatics and Geospatial standpoints. The codebase shall be primarily in python via jupyter notebooks.
